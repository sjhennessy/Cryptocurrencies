# Cryptocurrencies
Conduct unsupervised machine learning using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique for a cryptocurrency dataset.

## Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
* Create a 532 x 4 dataframe of traded cryptocurrencies
* Transform text features to 0/1 (get dummies)
* Scale data for analysis

## Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
* Reduce dimensions to 3 using PCA
* Create dataframe with 3 dimensions

## Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means (K=number of clusters)
* Cluster cryptocurrencies using K-means by first creating an elbow chart to determine k value
* Create model with 4 classes and make predictions
* Create dataframe by merging two dataframes (df's from Del 1 and Del 2)

## Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
* Visualize the results by creating a 3D scatterplot of the 3 dimensions
* Scale data for coins supply and coins mined
* Create 2D scatterplot for coins supply and coins mined
